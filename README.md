# COVID-19 Dataset

The original COVID-19 dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset

We utilized a preprocessed version of the original dataset: https://github.com/Atharva-Peshkar/Covid-19-Patient-Health-Analytics

We reprocessed the dataset via feature extraction and construction to make a more comprehensive analysis of the symptoms.

In the Excel file, the sheet named 'ready' is the final version of the dataset.
